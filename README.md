# CPU Design and Implementation (VHDL, FPGA)

This project implements a simple **CPU architecture** on an FPGA platform using **VHDL**.  
It covers instruction design, timing cycles, module structure, and verification through simulation and hardware testing.  

This course project was completed during my undergraduate studies in 2013 at Harbin Institute of Technology, as part of the course Computer System Design and Practice (è®¡ç®—æœºè®¾è®¡ä¸Žå®žè·µ).

## Overview

**Goal:**  
To design and implement a basic CPU that supports arithmetic, logic, and control instructions, with all core components written in VHDL and synthesized using **Xilinx ISE**.

**Environment:**
- **Xilinx ISE 9.1i** â€” synthesis and implementation  
- **ModelSim XE II v5.6a** â€” functional simulation  
- **SD2100 Digital Logic Design Platform** â€” hardware debugging and verification

---

## Objectives

- Master the **Xilinx ISE** and **ModelSim** toolchains  
- Learn and apply **VHDL programming**  
- Design a complete **CPU datapath and control unit**  
- Understand the **processor architecture** and instruction execution flow  
- Implement and test the design on an **FPGA board**

## CPU Architecture

### Core Modules

| Module | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| **Clock (`count.vhd`)** | Generates 4-phase timing signals (`T0â€“T3`) controlling all modules |
| **Fetch (`fetch.vhd`)** | Handles instruction fetching and PC updates |
| **ALU (`alu.vhd`)** | Executes arithmetic, logic, and address computations |
| **Store (`store.vhd`)** | Temporarily stores ALU or memory data |
| **Writeback (`writeback.vhd`)** | Writes computation results and PC values back to registers |
| **Memory Control (`memctrl.vhd`)** | Manages data transfer between CPU and RAM |
| **Top-Level (`cpu.vhd`)** | Integrates all modules and external interfaces |

## Instruction Design

### Instruction Format

Multiple formats are supported to handle:
- Immediate values
- Register-to-register operations
- Direct and indirect memory addressing
- Jump and conditional control instructions

| Example Format | Description |
|----------------|--------------|
| `op (5 bits) + reg (3 bits) + imm (8 bits)` | Register with immediate value |
| `op (5 bits) + reg1 (3 bits) + reg2 (3 bits)` | Register-to-register operations |
| `op (5 bits) + memory address (8 bits)` | Direct memory access |

### Example Opcodes

| Opcode | Instruction | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| `00000` | `mov reg, *` | Move immediate to register |
| `00001` | `mov reg, [*]` | Load from memory |
| `00010` | `mov [*], reg` | Store to memory |
| `00100` | `adc reg, *` | Add with carry |
| `01000` | `and reg, *` | Bitwise AND |
| `01110` | `jmp *` | Unconditional jump |
| `10000` | `jz *` | Jump if zero |
| `10001` | `mov reg, [reg]` | Indirect load |

## Timing Cycles

| Cycle | Operation |
|-------|------------|
| **T0** | Instruction fetch |
| **T1** | ALU / address / memory access |
| **T2** | Storage control |
| **T3** | Register or PC writeback |

---

## ðŸ”§ Simulation and Verification

Simulation is performed for all modules using **ModelSim**:

- **Clock module:** Verifies correct 4-phase generation  
- **Fetch module:** Tests instruction loading and PC update  
- **ALU module:** Confirms arithmetic, logic, and jump operations  
- **Writeback module:** Validates correct register and PC updates  
- **Memory control:** Confirms correct signal behavior for read/write cycles

## Example Instruction Sequence

| Instruction | Machine Code | Description |
|--------------|--------------|--------------|
| `mov reg7, 0` | `0700h` | Load 0 into R7 |
| `mov [50], reg7` | `1750h` | Store R7 into address 0x50 |
| `mov reg2, [50]` | `0A50h` | Load from address 0x50 into R2 |
| `adc reg5, 8` | `2508h` | Add 8 to R5 |
| `jmp 0030h` | `7030h` | Jump to address 0x30 |
| `jz 0030h` | `8030h` | Jump to 0x30 if zero flag is set |

## UCF (Pin Constraints)

The `cpu.ucf` file defines FPGA pin mapping for all I/O signals such as:
- Address bus (`abus<0â€“15>`)
- Data bus (`dbus<0â€“15>`)
- Control lines (`nrd`, `nwr`, `nmerq`, `nbhe`, `nble`)
- Debug LEDs (`tout`, `irout`, `reout`, etc.)
